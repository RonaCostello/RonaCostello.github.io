Welcome to my page! My name is Rona and I'm a PhD student in the [Dept. Plant Sciences](https://www.plants.ox.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"} at Oxford University. I'm interested in plant evolution and genetics and my PhD so far has primarily involved using bioinformatic techniques to study the evolution of plant cell organelles, such as the chloroplast. More information about my research can be found under [research](/research) and I'm based in the lab of [Dr. Steve Kelly](http://www.stevekellylab.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

####  Background  ####

Hailing from the South East of London, I then spent four years completing my undergraduate degree (an MBiolSci) in Biology at the University of Sheffield. During this time I did a masters project in the lab of [Prof. Andrew Fleming](http://fleminglab.group.shef.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"} looking at identifying genes which underlie vein patterning in rice. Other research experience includes a summer spent at the John Innes Centre in the lab of [Prof. Robert Sablowski](https://www.jic.ac.uk/directory/robert-sablowski/){:target="\_blank"} investigating how meristems (a collection of dividing cells in plants which are responsible for new growth) are maintained.
